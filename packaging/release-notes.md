# CR1-U v0.4.1

A from-scratch reimplementation of *Chaos Rings* for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android.

## What's new

- **Android-data fixes:** walking animations now play correctly on the field, dialogue boxes render correctly, and affected cutscenes retain their backgrounds. Shared rendering fixes also cover iOS and Vita data.
- **Control Hints setting:** hide or show the on-screen keyboard and controller help from Options → Game. The choice is saved between sessions.
- **Vita save importing:** import decrypted Vita saves directly from the native title-screen Options → Game → Import Vita Saves menu. Existing saves are backed up. The download also includes the optional command-line converter and instructions.
- **Level cap raised to 100.**

## Getting started

1. Download the file for your system and unzip it.
2. Start `chaosrings`. If it can't find your copy of the game, it asks you for one and sets it up.
3. Play.

- **Windows:** if SmartScreen warns about an unsigned program, choose *More info*, *Run anyway*.
- **macOS:** right-click `chaosrings.app` and choose *Open* (it isn't signed).
- **Linux:** `chmod +x` the AppImage, then run it.
- **Android:** install the APK, then copy your game files over USB into
  `Android/data/local.preservation.chaosrings/files/`, in an `ios/`, `android/` or `vita/` folder.

The README's "Your copy" section lists exactly which files each release needs.

## Good to know

- **No game data is included.** You need your own copy; the port reads it at run time.
- **Tested on:** Linux (played), Windows (under Wine). The macOS and Android builds are made by CI
  but haven't been run on real hardware yet. Reports are welcome.
- **DLSS** isn't in these builds (NVIDIA's library can't ship with GPL code); you can build it
  yourself (README, Platforms).
- Licence GPL-2.0-or-later (the macOS app is GPL-3.0 because of MoltenVK). A fan preservation
  project, not affiliated with Square Enix or Media.Vision.
